A cool injector for Windows x86/x86_64 process/dll. The main goal of this project is to test some WINAPI and Internals mechanism while helping me learning something in the process :). Some features were done based on random code found on the internet, although most of it was ported and fixed from stuff made for VC10-15 to GCC7.<br/><br />
All credits from ported codes are commentaries inside the code :)<br /> Some cool stuff resides commented because I didn't want to use it right now, mainly for debug purpose.
<br />
This project must be seen as an experimental tool :).

Build tips:<br />
1. Its depends on QT5 to be build, so remember to fixup project toolchains!!  
2. All *.s must be added to linkage by qmake automatically.
